# Investments Dashboard

## Overview

This is an investment dashboard that enables the user navigate dynamically through the entire tree of their investment portfolio.

Features of this application:

- Plain vanilla js
- Build in Webpack
- Scss
- Data coming from JSON starter file
- Sin waves using canvas

Please note that this is just a beta version of the app and that the "search by id" feature is not functional.

## Using the App

Click on the output fields containing different investments to navigate downwards in the tree and see a breakdown of these investments. The fixed investment-type buttons on top can be activated to see different investment metrics. See your navigation within the tree by following the navigation menu with clickable links.

## Under the Hood

- Hover css shows the user what is clickable, and where the navigation ends
- The user can follow her/his navigation path in the dynamically updating navigation menu
- HTML canvas effect and color scheme add a futuristic touch to dashboard

## Dependencies
